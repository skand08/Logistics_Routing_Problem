# Logistics_Routing_Problem
 The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem that focuses on efficiently routing a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods or services to a set of locations. The objective is to determine the most cost-effective routes for the trucks while satisfying various constraints i.e. equal time taken, balanced distances traveled, etc.
